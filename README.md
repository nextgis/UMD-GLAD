UMD GLAD classifier
-------------------
Landsat time-sequential metric visualization and classification

The Landsat time-sequential metric visualization and classification module was
developed by the Global Land Analysis & Discovery (GLAD) team at the University
of Maryland, College Park, USA and the NEXTGIS R&D Company, Moscow, Russia. This
module is designed to work with tiled Landsat composite data produced by the
GLAD team.

The classification module is built on the basis of open source tools: Minimalist
GNU for Windows (licensed by GNU General Public License); Geospatial Data
Abstraction Library (licensed by Open Source Geospatial Foundation);
Classification and Regression Trees (author: Brian Ripley). The visualization
and classification module is distributed by glad.geog.umd.edu. You are free to
use, modify and copy this package as long as you credit the code source. The
module is distributed without warranty of any kind.
